The [promises](https://github.com/JScearcy/angular-promises/tree/master/app/promises) folder contains naive implementations of a http object and resource object. 
While it mimics the functionality of the $http and $resource modules, the code is not as robust as the actual implementations.
This is to provide a simpler to understand idea of what is happening "under the covers."
